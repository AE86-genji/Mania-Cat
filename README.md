Bongo cat overlay for VSRG

Credits: u/PunyFlash and their bongo cat key tracker. It was helpful to see how they built theirs when trying to optimize this project.

Now supports 8k. Make sure it is not minimized or it won't work. The .exe files should be self-explanatory. Use the other one when you want to see the cat in-game (ONLY works in borderless). You can also edit the sprites if you don't like my shitty mspaint skill, just don't change their names.
